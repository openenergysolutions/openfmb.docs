# Introduction

OpenFMB HMI is a Human Machine Interface web-based application used to design single-line diagrams with control and monitor capabilities.

## Overview

- **Diagram Management**: 
    - create/update/delete diagrams
    - export/import diagram

- **Diagram Designer**:

    Design mode is used to design single-line diagram. Electrical symbols are dragged and dropped into design canvas. Symbols are then connected together to make a meaningful single line diagrams representing an electrical distribution infrastructure. Symbols can then be mapped to specific OpenFMB data points for real-time display of information from microgrids, substations, etc.    

- **Run-time Mode**: 
    
    Run-time mode is diagrams in action supervising data and/or controling the underlined microgrid or substations

- **User management**: 

   - create/update/delete users

   - role assignment: 

       - viewer role: read-only

       - engineer role: viewer role + create diagram

       - admin role: engineer role + user management
