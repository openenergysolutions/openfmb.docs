# Reference Setup

In this reference setup you will see how to use OpenFMB with open-source software from [Open Energy Solutions Inc](https://openenergysolutionsinc.com).

The reference setup uses Docker and Docker Compose to run several pre-built Docker images containing open-source software developed by Open Energy Solutions and others. 

The three docker images that are run in the reference setup are: 
1. A [NATS](https://nats.io) server
2. An [Adapter](https://github.com/openenergysolutions/openfmb.adapters) replaying pre-recorded data
3. An [HMI](https://github.com/openenergysolutions/openfmb.hmi) for visualizing and displaying the data coming from the Adapter over NATS.

## Install Docker Compose

In order to run the demonstration, you will need to [install Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). 

## Get The Demo Configuration

Next, [download an archive](https://github.com/openenergysolutions/openfmb.demo/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip) of the demonstration setup.

## Run the Demo

Unzip the demo zip file in a place of your choosing. 

On Linux or Mac, open a terminal. On Windows, open a cmd.exe or PowerShell terminal. Next, change directory (cd) to the unzipped demo directory and run the following command: 

```bash
docker-compose up
```

At this point terminal should look similar to the following:

## Browse to the HMI


The HMI is accessible locally while Docker Compose is running. 

[http://localhost:32771](http://localhost:32771) 

Log in with the username 'admin' and the password 'hm1admin'. 

The first screen should look similar to the following: 

![](img/demo_hmi_initial.png)

Browsing first to Diagrams.

![](img/demo_hmi_diagrams.png)

Then to the microgrid diagram.

![](img/demo_hmi_microgrid.png)

The information on the screen should update in real time. 

## What's Happening in the Background

The values updating in the HMI come from the Adapter publishing pre-recorded OpenFMB messages encoded as [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) with [NATS](https://nats.io) acting as a message broker.

You should see replay_1 log messages in the console. Those are coming from the [Adapter](https://github.com/openenergysolutions/openfmb.adapters).

## Where to Go From Here

The [Adapter](https://github.com/openenergysolutions/openfmb.adapters) is capable of much more than replaying data. Itâ€™s capable of mapping simulated and real devices that provide commonly used power grid protocols such as DNP3 and Modbus. 

The Adapter can also record all messages to a [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org)-powered
[TimescaleDB](https://timescaledb.com),allowing for offline data analysis, dashboards powered by [Grafana](https://grafana.com) or other such visualization tools.

Lastly, the Adapter is the basis for a broader set of software Open Energy Solutions Inc. is developing to enable distributed intelligence for the power grid.
