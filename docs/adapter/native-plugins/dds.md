# DDS

[The OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS)](https://www.dds-foundation.org/) is a standard protocol that provides
low-latency data connectivity with optional extreme reliability for
mission-critical IoT applications. It is mainly used in domains like aerospace,
defense, ATC, robotics and smart grid management.

## RTI

DDS is implemented using [RTI Connext DDS](https://www.rti.com/) 6.0.1. This is
a proprietary library and requires a license to use.

:::important
The prebuilt Docker images are not built with DDS enabled.
