# What's New

The OpenFMB Adapter, along with the new [extensible framework](/docs/adapter-extensions/), empowers grid-edge solutions and enables distributed intelligence. Besides DNP3 and MODBUS, OpenFMB Adapter v2.1 offers support for the following  protocols:

- Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP)
- Inter-Control Center Communications Protocol (ICCP)
- IEC-61850 (MMS and GOOSE)
- Open Automated Demand Response (OpenADR)
- SEP 2.0 or IEEE 2030.5

This comprehensive compatibility allows seamless integration of diverse devices and systems, fostering efficient communication and interoperability within the smart grid ecosystem as well as Electric Vehicle (EV) and EV management. By leveraging the OpenFMB Adapter and its extensible framework, organizations can unlock the potential of grid-edge technologies and harness the benefits of distributed intelligence in their energy management and control applications.
